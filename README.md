# Infinite Cursor

Infinite Cursor is a Python script designed to create a seamless cursor movement experience by wrapping around the screen edges.
When the mouse cursor reaches the edges of the the screen, the script automatically moves the cursor to the opposite side, creating the illusion of an infinite desktop space.

## Usage

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
